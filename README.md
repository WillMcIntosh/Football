# Football!

Score Tracker App for Grow With Google Android Basics Nanodegree. Project two of the nanodegree is a simple score keeper app for any sport or game. I used American Football and have buttons to increment the score for a touchdown, extra point, field goal, and safety for both teams. The reset button will reset both scores to 0.

I also added EditText areas to enter custom team names.
